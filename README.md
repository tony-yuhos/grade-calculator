## Why I made this project

Grade Calculators are a great tool for determining what score you need to get to achieve a certain grade and estimating the probability for that to happen.  
However, I didn't like the way many grade calculators online are formatted, having to enter weight percentages for every item.  
In my solution, you instead choose weighted categories for each graded item, making entering many items much easier.

## Run the Project

First, cd to the repository, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use the calculator.
